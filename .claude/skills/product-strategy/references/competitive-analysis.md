## Differentiation Strategies

### Types of Differentiation

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Feature** | Unique capabilities | Only product with X |
| **Quality** | Superior execution | Fastest, most reliable |
| **Service** | Better support | 24/7, dedicated success |
| **Price** | Cost leadership | Cheapest option |
| **Focus** | Niche expertise | Built for [specific segment] |
| **Experience** | UX excellence | Easiest to use |
| **Integration** | Ecosystem fit | Works with everything |

### Sustainable Differentiation

Differentiation is sustainable when:
- It's hard to copy (technology, network effects)
- It's valued by customers (willingness to pay)
- It's aligned with your strengths (can defend)
- It's durable (won't commoditize quickly)
